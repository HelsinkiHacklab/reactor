Draft for Adruino<->DBUS console communication
consoles are inited with 
python ardubridge.py console_config.cfg 

console config will describe how to map signal to methods that active atual
leds/gauges/etc by communicating simple serial commands to Arduino

Arduino reads switches / other inputs and send simple commands that are 
mapped to DBUS signals 

types to map:
TODO

gauge -> set input for servo gauge 
led -> just set led N
...
