# Console power meter

ATTiny84 displaying on LCD the voltages and currents on the 5V and 3.3V power buses of the rod control console.

Standard hitachi-style 2x16 LCD module, two Pololu current sensors (due to availability two different ones: [ACS714][1] & [ACS715][2])

This is wired up on stripboard, I'll draw a schematic when I get around to it.
