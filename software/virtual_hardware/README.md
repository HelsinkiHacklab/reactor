# Virtual reactor hardware

PySide/QML versions of the physical control consoles, for testing the simulation engine

## TODO

  * Refactor the controllers to one baseclass
  * Figure out one good way to map the arDuBUS functionality to QML (now it's done in a bit of a mixed way)
  * Figure out how to maintain the pin numbers etc in sync when arDuBUS will use YAML mapping files and code
    generated from them.
