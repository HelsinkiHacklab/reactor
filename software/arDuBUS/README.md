# arDuBUS: Arduino <-> DBUS bridge

**NOTE** development of this library has been moved to https://github.com/rambo/arDuBUS I will clean up this repo and write instuctions etc when I have more time.

To control your arduino via the "real" computer and vice versa

Includes sketch generator and a bunch of code, also some support for virtualized hardware (for testing the stuff running on the computer without having to wire everything up every time)

# TODO

  - Refactoring
  - Separate to own repo (the code is general even if the "example" configs aren't)
