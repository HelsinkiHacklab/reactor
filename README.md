# A nuclear reactor simulator / game project, by Helsinki Hacklab.

Uses physical consoles with buttons and gauges for input and output and a linux computer running various pieces of interfacing and simulation software.

Design and plans in etherpad here: http://kirjoitusalusta.fi/hacklab-reactor

NOTE: now uses submodules, remember "git submodule init" "git submodule update"

## Camp Pixelache 2012 (planned)

We're planning on finalizing at least the pieces that almost worked at ALT party and maybe add something extra.
