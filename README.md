# A nuclear reactor simulator / game project, by [Helsinki Hacklab][hlab].

Uses physical consoles with buttons and gauges for input and output and a linux computer running various pieces of interfacing and simulation software.

Design and plans in etherpad here: http://kirjoitusalusta.fi/hacklab-reactor

## ALT Party 2011

We didn't quite finish everything in time but still got very nice feedback, photos at http://www.hacklab.fi/2011/10/alt-party-ohi-helsinki-yha-olemassa/ ([Google translated][1]), Jeri shot a video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjDI3drK0fk

## Camp Pixelache 2012

The game was playable and we made a lot of alarm noises, the dials indicating control rod positions were missing though (we didn't have enough time to re-do them as most of the servos used at ALT party were dead).

Some photos from the event and late nights preceding it can be seen in this [article][2] (text in Finnish, [Google Translated][3])

## [WÃ„RK:fest][wark] 2012

We managed to get the control console to a mostly working state, also the reactor lid worked fine (apart from some minor glitches), even the smoke-machine controls worked (the smoke machine itself has to be
 repaired too, the pump-control triac had given up it's magic-smoke and had to be replaced).

## Model Expo 2014

Only the console was there, it still was a major attraction.

## Assembly (Summer) 2014

<http://hacklab.fi> was part of <http://puuhanurkka.fi> and the whole reactor setup was there, partycoded tweaks FTW. Pics:

## Next: ??

Don't know yet, but improvements will continue, at some point we will get around to making the [coms-console][coms_jeri] functional too ([Turku hacklab][tku] has shown some interest in working on the plant-control console, seen as the rightmost console on the coms-picture)
