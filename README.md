# A nuclear reactor simulator / game project, by Helsinki Hacklab.

Uses physical consoles with buttons and gauges for input and output and a linux computer running various pieces of interfacing and simulation software.

Design and plans in etherpad here: http://kirjoitusalusta.fi/hacklab-reactor 

A phone-cam video of the first console in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdirVpwifV0

NOTE: now uses submodules, remember "git submodule init" "git submodule update"

## ALT Party 2011

We didn't quite finish everything in time but still got very nice feedback, photos at http://www.hacklab.fi/2011/10/alt-party-ohi-helsinki-yha-olemassa/ ([Google translated][1]), Jeri shot a video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjDI3drK0fk

## Camp Pixelache 2012

The game was playable and we made a lot of alarm noises, the dials indicating control rod positions were missing though (we didn't have enough time to re-do them as most of the servos used at ALT party were dead).

Some photos from the event and late nights preceding it can be seen in this [article][2] (text in Finnish, [Google Translated][3])

## Next: WÃ„RK

http://www.warkfest.org/en/ we hope to get rest of the dials done by then and adding a simple scoring logic.
