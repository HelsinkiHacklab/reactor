# A nuclear reactor simulator / game project, by Helsinki Hacklab.

Uses physical consoles with buttons and gauges for input and output and a linux computer running various pieces of interfacing and simulation software.

Design and plans in etherpad here: http://kirjoitusalusta.fi/hacklab-reactor

NOTE: now uses submodules, remember "git submodule init" "git submodule update"

# Exhibitions

## ALT Party 2011

We didn't quite finish everything in time but still got very nice feedback, photos at http://www.hacklab.fi/2011/10/alt-party-ohi-helsinki-yha-olemassa/

## Camp Pixelache 2012

The game was playable and we made a lot of alarm noises, the dials indicating control rod positions were missing though (we didn't have enough time to re-do them as most of the servos used at ALT party were dead).

## ???

Where to next ? We'll continue by finishing the dials and tuning the gameplay.
