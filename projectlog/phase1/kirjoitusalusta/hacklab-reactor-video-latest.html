<body><u>Hacklabin reaktoriprojektiin ( </u><a href="http://kirjoitusalusta.fi/hacklab-reactor"><u>http://kirjoitusalusta.fi/hacklab-reactor</u></a><u> ) tarvittavat videopätkät</u><br
/><br
/><b>Filmaukset labilla, vapaaehtoisia näyttelijöitä kaivataan, näyttelytaidot ja irtoparta optionaalisia!</b><br
/><br
/>Video consists of ~10-30 sec clips where character walks into picture, does something or calls control room, and walks out afterwards.&nbsp; When calling the control room, the clip is stopped and restarted at the time where the technician is waiting for the control room to pick up, so that it can be freezed there while the phone rings in the simulator.&nbsp; The clips can then be played in any order, and there can always be some video of the location.<br
/><br
/>Language is english with russian accent (hollywood russian accent is ok, doesn't need to be very good).&nbsp; See e.g. <a href="http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-do-a-russian-accent">http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-do-a-russian-accent</a><br
/><br
/>Filming is done on location in hacklab house.<br
/><br
/><b>Video sequences for various plant technicians</b><br
/><ul><li>Video of location with no technician for 2 sec, 5 sec, 10 sec.</li
><li>Technician reports problem on device nr x, and usually requests for it to be stopped or something done for it.&nbsp; (Usually it ceases to function, but it might also have been jammed at the current position.)&nbsp; (Might also be a request to not run a device too high / low until it is fixed, instead of requiring to stop it)</li
><li>Technician reports that device x has been fixed, and can be restarted or used again.</li
><li>Technician reports that control room started a device while repairs where ongoing, and assistant z has died.&nbsp; There are 2-3 different assistants per location.&nbsp; For last one, technician reports bitterly that no more repairs can be done at that location.</li
><li>Technician walks in, does something idle, and walks out</li
><li>Technician walks in, repairs / works on some equipment, and walks out</li
><li>Technician walks in, answers phone, says everything is under control.&nbsp; There should be 2-3 normal ones, and 1-3 where the technician becomes more and more agitated about the repeated disturbance.</li
><li>Accident is happening, lights failing, technican runs in, panics or other response to emergency, and leaves.</li
><li>Accident is happening, lights blink, no technician</li
><li>Emergency lights (power out), no technician<br/><br
/></li></ul
>Boss and Tutor characters don't need to walk in / out of the screen, as they are not monitorable on CCTV, they just call you or can be called.<br

></li
><li>Blew up plant speech<ul><li>"You destroyed great nuclear plant of motherland!&nbsp; You go to Siberia and never come back!"</li></ul
></li
><li><b>TODO: </b>Imposing logo on wall behind desk, militarish hat / uniform, medals!</li></ul
></li
><li><b><s>Nuclear expert Dimitri</s> ('tutor' of players) - Optional, do later</b><ul><li>Actor:<b> </b>Open!</li
><li>Dimitri sits at desk or indicator panel, looks or feels a bit like Einstein.&nbsp; Not subject to the normal closed circuit TV, so doesn't need to enter and exit the frame between each scene, just calls / answers and closes the phone.&nbsp; Players can call Dimitri for tips, or Dimitri can call players with advice.</li
><li>Filming location: Maybe conference room?&nbsp; (with blackboard in background and rotating chair?)</li
><li>Introductory explanation<ul><li>"Hello, I am Dimitri, professor on nuclear physics from Helsingrad University.&nbsp; I will be giving you advice on runing nuclear reactor, but you will need to be doing the running yourselves.&nbsp; To start with, you see the reactor control panel, with many buttons and many lights.&nbsp; The buttons are used to lift and sink control rods into the reactor core, they control how fast the nuclear reaction is, and how much heat is generated.&nbsp; The bigger control panel with large buttons is the control panel for the rest of the plant.&nbsp; From there, you control the cooling system of the reactor, and the turbines that make electricity of the steam coming from the reactor.&nbsp; On the top of it, you can see overview of whole nuclear plant system.&nbsp; And finally at this panel you can see the other rooms in the plant, and there is videophone system that will ring if there is problem somewhere.&nbsp; Good luck!"</li></ul
></li
><li>Situation specific advice (dimitri calls players to tell these)<ul><li>"Reactor is too hot, add more water!"</li
><li>"Now you put too many control rods in, reactor has gone out.&nbsp; Pull some out, carefully!"</li
><li>"You have too many control rods out, reaction is getting too intense.&nbsp; Put some control rods in!"</li
><li>"Fuel&nbsp; rods are overheating and jumping up!&nbsp; You should send brave technician&nbsp; to reactor floor and stomp down fuel rods that glow white!"</li
><li>"There is not enough cooling for reactor, pump in more cooling water!"</li
><li><b>TODO</b>: Some more</li></ul
></li
><li>General tips (these Dimitri tells if players call him)<ul><li>On controlling reactor<ul><li>"Nuclear&nbsp; reactor is controlled with control rods.&nbsp; A control rod absorbs&nbsp; neutrons, and slows down fission reaction.&nbsp; Control rod can be moved&nbsp; more or less into reactor, so it slows it down more or less."</li
><li>"Some&nbsp; control rods are going in from top, some are going in from bottom.&nbsp; You&nbsp; can see this from the control rod indicator, it is numbered clockwise&nbsp; when rod goes in from top and counter clockwise when rod goes up from&nbsp; bottom"</li
><li>"If water get too hot, it boil away in reactor.&nbsp; Water absorbs neutrons, but steam does not, so reactor will have more neutrons, and heat up more"</li
><li>"Controlling nuclear reactor is like driving very large ship.&nbsp; You move control rod, reactor slowly follow.&nbsp; You move many control rods, nothing happen at first, then boom! much happen at once!"</li
><li>"If&nbsp; steam forms inside reactor, it will react with fuel rod and make&nbsp; hydrogen.&nbsp; When hydrogen collects, boom!&nbsp; Hydrogen explosion!&nbsp; Not good"</li
><li>"RBMK&nbsp; reactor uses graphite between fuel rods to slow neutrons, so they can&nbsp; collide more and increase fission.&nbsp; Graphite grow very hot, over 700&nbsp; degrees celsius.&nbsp; If air get into cooling system, graphite will start to&nbsp; burn, not good, very hard to put out."</li></ul
></li
><li>On communication<ul><li>"When getting request to increase or decrease power, I find it good practice to write it down on paper, so I remember"</li
><li>"You can press buttons under tv screen to see locations around plant, or to call me."</li></ul
></li
><li>On plant operation<ul><li>"Remember to keep water fowing, if water stop, reactor heat up, not good"</li
><li>"Nuclear plant need regular maintenance, otherwise machines will fail and pipes will break.&nbsp; But there is no maintenance planned yet for five years, so watch out."</li
><li>"When machine is being repaired, do not start it up, or repair technician may get hurt"</li></ul
></li
><li>General<ul><li>"There is manual for plant laying around somewhere.&nbsp; You should read it well!"</li
><li>"Radioactivity is not so dangerous, is actually healthy in small dose.&nbsp; You can put it in toothpaste!&nbsp; It glow in dark!"</li
><li>"RBMK reactors are like cargo train.&nbsp; Boring to run, but if operator go to sleep, boom! there is crash!"</li
><li>"RBMK reactor can be used for making plutonium for bomb, you do not even need to stop reactor to take out fuel rod.&nbsp; Plant construction is top secret because of this, beware of foreign spies!"</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>Responses to being called repeatedly (first some general tip is played, afterwards these)<ul><li>"You are doing fine, just continue like that"</li
><li>"I don't have any more advice at the moment"</li
><li>"I'm busy, call again later"</li
><li>"Sorry, but I can not help you from here.&nbsp; You have to manage on your own!"</li
><li>"Hello again, how is it going?&nbsp; Sorry, I can't hear you, there is sputnik on radio now.&nbsp; You have to call afterwards"<br/><br
