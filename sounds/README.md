# Samples

Collection of samples used by the reactor simulator. Since we use GStreamer to play these any format it can handle is ok (ie, just about anything. Of course the format needs to be non-lossy as well so the samples can be edited later as needed so I guess FLAC would be a good choice)

When making layered loops etc please provide also the individual samples used.

Feel free to reorganize the file hierarchy when needed, see also: https://github.com/HelsinkiHacklab/reactor/tree/master/software/noisemaker
